#Functions-Time to end CORONA
#Problem Description
#Given three integers, A, B and C. You have to find the number of days it will take to reach zero cases of Corona in a city.

#A - Average cases recovered in a day of the corona.
#B - Number of new cases of corona daily.
#C - Current active cases of the corona.

#Return the minimum number of days it will take to reach 0 active cases of Covid.

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B, C):
        count = 0
        while C > 0:
            C += B
            C -= A
            count += 1
        return count
